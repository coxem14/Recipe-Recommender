# Capstone-3 Proposal

### Recipe Recommender
Getting to the data:
1. I came across this [website](https://recipe-search.typesense.org/) (open source recipe search) 
2. I went to the [GitHub](https://github.com/typesense/showcase-recipe-search) and found a [link](https://github.com/Glorf/recipenlg) to the dataset on another GitHub
3. The actual dataset is hosted on a project [website](https://recipenlg.cs.put.poznan.pl/)
4. I agreed to the Terms and Conditions and downloaded the dataset
5. Notes from the GitHub: The dataset is 2.2 GB on disk, with ~2.2 million rows. It took 8 minutes to index this dataset on a 3-node Typesense cluster with 4vCPUs per node and the index was 2.7GB in RAM.
